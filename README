Yawns-Planet
------------

  This software is designed to output a "PlanetPlanet" like collection
 of webpages.


Rationale
---------

  Using PlanetPlanet entries are fetched by making HTTP requests to
 remote servers.  In the case of Yawns it is much more efficient to
 directly query the database, and avoid the HTTP request and 
 feed processing.

  This approach also has at least the following advantage(s):

	* It allows the display to contain more information than
          is permitted upon a PlanetPlanet installation.


Installation
------------

  Checkout from CVS, then edit the file "conf/SiteConfig.pm" to
 make sure the database connections are setup.

  Once that has done simply invoke:

	./yp

  This will read the templates from ./templates/ and output
 files to the directory ./html/

  If you wish you may customize the template files before updating
 them.  They are standard HTML::Template files.
