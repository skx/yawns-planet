Yawns-Planet
------------

  This software is designed to output a "PlanetPlanet" like collection
 of webpages.


Rationale
---------

  Using PlanetPlanet entries are fetched by making HTTP requests to
 remote servers.  In the case of Yawns it is much more efficient to
 directly query the database, and avoid the HTTP request and 
 feed processing.

  This approach also has at least the following advantage(s):

	* It allows the display to contain more information than
          is permitted upon a PlanetPlanet installation.
        * It avoids invoking Yawns to generate each XML feed for the
          subscribed users.
        * It will work if your Yawns installation doesn't have weblog
          feeds available.

  Since we're working directly with the database contents we also have
 a natural ability to search for previous entries.  The file
 cgi-bin/index.cgi allows visitors to perform searches.



Requirements
------------

  Using this software makes no sense if you're not running an
 installation of Yawns.

  If you have Yawns installed then the only additional requirements
 are the following Perl modules:

	Date::Manip
	DBI
	HTML::Entities
	HTML::Template
  
  The latter two you will have installed to run Yawns.  The first
 can be installed upon a Debian host with:

	apt-get install libdate-manip-perl


Installation
------------

  Checkout from CVS, then edit the file "conf/SiteConfig.pm" to
 make sure the database connections are setup.

  Once that has done simply invoke:

	./yp

  This will read the templates from ./templates/ and output
 files to the directory ./html/

  If you wish you may customize the template files before updating
 them.  (They are standard HTML::Template files.)



Apache Setup
------------

  Apache should be setup to allow CGI scripts to run if you wish
 to use the search function.

  Installation will look something like this:

	cd /home/www/planet.foo.com/
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvsrepository.org:/home/cvs login
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvsrepository.org:/home/cvs co yawns-planet
	ln -s yawns-planet/html    html
	ln -s yawns-planet/cgi-bin cgi-bin
	

  Then your Apache setup will look something like this:

	<VirtualHost>
	   ServerName planet.foo.com
	   DocumentRoot /home/www/planet.foo.com/htdocs
	   ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/www/planet.foo.com/cgi-bin
           <Location /cgi-bin>
                Options +ExecCGI
           </Location>
	</VirtualHost>
