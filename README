Yawns-Planet
------------

  This software is designed to output a "PlanetPlanet" like collection
 of webpages.


Rationale
---------

  Using PlanetPlanet entries are fetched by making HTTP requests to
 remote servers.  In the case of Yawns it is much more efficient to
 directly query the database, and avoid the HTTP request and 
 feed processing.

  This approach also has at least the following advantage(s):

	* It allows the display to contain more information than
          is permitted upon a PlanetPlanet installation.

        * It avoids invoking Yawns to generate each XML feed for the
          subscribed users.

        * It will work if your Yawns installation doesn't have weblog
          feeds available.

  Since we're working directly with the database contents we also have
 a natural ability to search for previous entries.  The file
 cgi-bin/index.cgi allows visitors to perform searches.



Requirements
------------

  Using this software makes no sense if you're not running an
 installation of Yawns.

  If you have Yawns installed already the only additional software
 you need is the perl module:

	Date::Manip
  
  This can be installed upon a Debian host with the following command:

	apt-get install libdate-manip-perl


Installation
------------

  Checkout from CVS:

    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvsrepository.org:/home/cvs login
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvsrepository.org:/home/cvs co yawns-planet

  Once you have a copy of the software downloaded you will need to
 configure it by editting the file "conf/SiteConfig.pm". The settings
 there should be obvious.

  After you have updated any settings you care about you may generate
 the output pages by running:

	./yp
  or

	make planet

  If you wish you may customize the template files before updating
 them.  (They are standard HTML::Template files.)



Search Setup
------------

  If you wish to allow users to search previous entries for keywords
 then you must ensure that you have an Apache setup which allows execution
 of CGI scripts.

  Installation will look something like this:

	mkdir -p /home/www/planet.foo.com/
	cd /home/www/planet.foo.com/
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvsrepository.org:/home/cvs login
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvsrepository.org:/home/cvs co yawns-planet
	ln -s yawns-planet/html    html
	ln -s yawns-planet/cgi-bin cgi-bin
	

  The corresponding Apache setup will look something like this:

	<VirtualHost>
	   ServerName planet.foo.com
	   DocumentRoot /home/www/planet.foo.com/htdocs
	   ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/www/planet.foo.com/cgi-bin
           <Location /cgi-bin>
                Options +ExecCGI
           </Location>
	</VirtualHost>


Testing
-------

  There are some minimal code tests included within the tests/
 subdirectory.

  To execute them run:

	make test

  Any failures are bugs, and should be reported.
