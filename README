Yawns-Planet
------------

  This software is designed to output a "PlanetPlanet" like collection
 of webpages, by directly querying a Yawns database.

  This has several attractions:

	* It allows the display to contain more information than
          is permitted upon a PlanetPlanet installation.
        * It doesn't require hitting your webserver to fetch
          a list of feeds.

  The software will directly query the weblog, users, and 
 comments table to detect the recent weblogs.
